Important notes:
    Since we have access to position, speed and acceleration discretely specified
    in each axis, and since we can assume our unmaned vehicle to be free floating in water
    making movement in each axis independent of movement in the others, we simplify our problem
    to two Kalman Filter iterations.
    
    We will separately calculate our position and pose:
        - position from LBL and an estimate from linear velocity and acceleration
        - pose from angular velocity and acceleration
    
    If we have no easy way to infer our pose with any sensor, our location will always be
    more accurate than our pose, but due to the way our sensors work that will not be
    an issue for our localization problem.
    
    If it can't be done here, let the programmer in charge of the control module deal
    with it...
